# DH 150 Assignment 07 - High-Fidelity Prototype by Christine Yu
## UCLA Economics Website Prototype

# Brief Summary: Purpose and Process
- This is a high-fidelity test for the UCLA Economics Website. I created this prototype by using Figma. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of performing three tasks. These three tasks were inspired by three personas from a prior assignment: Justin, Betty, and Peter. The key tasks are improved search results, ability to add workshop event to a calendar, and access to an international resource section. 

- The process began by consulting my low fidelity prototype on paper and translating those components to graphic components in Figma. I utilized color contrast between the colors found on the UCLA website to highlight typography in the foreground. I consulted the original UCLA Economics website to figure out the positioning of images and graphic elements such as the search bar. I first developed the home page and used that as the main base for the wireframes by maintaining consistency on the layout of the top banner and footer.  By moving through each task, I created wireframes that logically followed the flow of the task. To complete the prototype, I would check each wireframe and ensure that the buttons are properly connected to the next wireframe. 

# Tasks supported by the Interactive Prototype
- A HOME Button on each UCLA Economics page at the top left corner (that returns to the home page)
- Search by using the search bar that provides detailed search results
- Search suggestions are offered by the search bar
- Can navigate to the International Student Resources page 
- Calendar Date Selection for Workshops
- Edit personal information before confirmation
- Link workshop registration to a calendar of choice
- Sign up for workshops

# Color Scheme and Accessibility

- I chose the color scheme based on the original colors of the UCLA Economics website. The UCLA Economics website utilizes blue, white, and black primarily. I started off utlizing the theme colors within Figma. One of the theme colors was called Blue 1 (#2F80ED) and I originally assumed that there would be no issues with contrast because it appeared similar to the color utilized on the website. When testing the accessibility of colors, I discovered that it failed to qualify for 4.5:1 ratio with the white background (#FFFFFF). I decided to change the saturation to a darker shade of blue (#1D6FDE). This shade of blue fulfilled the WCAG 2.0 AA level.

- I also checked the contrast between black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF). It passed all color contrast testing.

- I wanted to check the level of contrast between the color of the search bar and the background shade of blue (#1D6FDE); however, Figma did not show me the color in hexadecimal format. The search bar color utilized a surface overlay which meant it was a darkened shade of the background color of 12%. Because of this, I am unsure if the level of contrast is satisfactory for the search bar.
