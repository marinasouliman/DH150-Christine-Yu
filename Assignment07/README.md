# DH 150 Assignment 07 - High-Fidelity Prototype by Christine Yu
## UCLA Economics Website Prototype

# Brief Summary: Purpose and Process
- This is a high-fidelity test for the UCLA Economics Website. I created this prototype by using Figma. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of performing three tasks. These three tasks were inspired by three personas from a prior assignment: Justin, Betty, and Peter. The key tasks are improved search results, ability to add workshop event to a calendar, and access to an international resource section. 

- The process began by consulting my low fidelity prototype on paper and translating those components to graphic components in Figma. I utilized color contrast between the colors found on the UCLA website to highlight typography in the foreground. I consulted the original UCLA Economics website to figure out the positioning of images and graphic elements such as the search bar. I first developed the home page and used that as the main base for the wireframes by maintaining consistency on the layout of the top banner and footer.  By moving through each task, I created wireframes that logically followed the flow of the task. To complete the prototype, I would check each wireframe and ensure that the buttons are properly connected to the next wireframe. 

# Tasks supported by the Interactive Prototype
- A HOME Button on each UCLA Economics page at the top left corner (that returns to the home page)
- Search by using the search bar that provides detailed search results
- Search suggestions are offered by the search bar
- Can navigate to the International Student Resources page 
- Calendar Date Selection for Workshops
- Edit personal information before confirmation
- Link workshop registration to a calendar of choice
- Sign up for workshops
