# DH 150 Assignment 4- Christine Yu

## Design Challenge

The main activity my project would focus on is searching for academic coursework and related academic topics. This satisfies the user’s need for understanding the logical progression of their future course plans and evaluating the intellectual value that their courses provide. Many college students require this information to determine their career path in the future; thereby, it is necessary to have an efficient and clear way to find this important information. This task also may impact the student’s financial security because if a student fails to pick the right course, it results in wasted money spent on unnecessary coursework. The traditional solution is to visit a counselor in person and spend time formulating a 4 year course pathway. While this solution is optimal because the counselor will likely have the most up to date information, classes sometimes fill up quickly and a student will need the flexibility to change and alter their course pathway as needed. Another current solution is to utilize the department’s website and use a search bar to find the handbook or a sample course pathway. This solution lacks an element of personalization for tailoring the course work.

 Some limitations that could be improved with digital technology is the lack of flexibility to change course pathways and degree of personalization. By utilizing AI assistants that provide feedback through question and answer or online counselors, a student will be able to search all the available academic courses and ask specific questions about prerequisites to an online assistant on the same website. Digital technology can also be used to quickly revise a schedule that would be difficult to change on paper. The website I focused on for previous assignments, the UCLA Economics website, struggles with providing good search results and I would like to use this user research to provide context for how other sites deliver search results and how users perceive the search process. 

## Target Users

I seek users that would need to search for academic coursework topics. These users are primarily students, typically ranging from high school to graduate school age, during which the user is able to take part in deciding their coursework. Additional users include parents of these students who would assist in guiding the student through future coursework. The users would have varying degrees of proficiency with technology. Depending on the age and level of proficiency, there would be a range of preferences between digital search materials and physical papers. The users would perform the activity at home or in school environments by searching online or asking a counselor in person. 

## Research Plan and Process

I will conduct an interview with the user. The user will be seated at their home at their desk. The user can reference their own digital tool such as a phone or computer as well as any paperwork they would use in their academic search process. I will be in a Zoom call with the user and I will be screen recording. I will also be recording their voice for transcription purposes. 

I will be going through a script and taking notes on the digital document while passively observing the user. I will interject intermittently with questions about their task and thought process. For each search, the user will explain how they decide on keywords and the degree of satisfaction they achieve. 

I will conclude the interview by thanking the user for their time and asking for any suggestions to improve the search process. I will continue taking notes to wrap up the observations I made during the interview.

I will be taking notes on the same script document.

## Reflection 

Overall, the process went smoothly because I was able to ask most of the questions. I was surprised by the user's choice of website, which did not feature a search bar, so some of the questions did not fully apply. I had to revise the question on the spot or skip over questions that did not apply. There are some slight audio problems due to internet connection. This presents some difficulties during the transcription process. While I am able to perform this contextual research process online, there are some disadvantages. I am unable to fully observe the user's posture and movements during the Zoom call so I could not determine if there was some slight discomfort or changes in behavior. There was some confusion due to the phrasing of questions. I will try to read the questions out loud before I present in front of a user the next time I try to perform user research. This would relieve some of the issues the user had with understanding the context of my question. The background questions went pretty smoothly. 

The primary insights I found through this process is that search for the users is primarily performed through computer and that means the website experience should be optimized for the computer. I also learned that website design can be offputting for navigating searches and a search experience should be intuitive. Academic information that is commonly searched for are course descriptions, materials and textbooks required, and professor's ratings. I realized that the UCLA Economics website lacks the ability to look for ratings. Users prefer to have commonly used websites bookmarked to save the information for later. Users also like to have a variety of results through partial search terms. I have learned that I require even more advanced preparation beforehand for typos, revision to avoid confusion, and flexiblity to deal with unexpected changes. I also learned that by observing the user, you are not letting your own preconceived notions about what works and what doesn't to influence the flow of the conversation. In the previous user testing, the guidance through the tasks often limited what users would do and say. This new process allows users to perform regular tasks that they would do in the comfort of their own environment. I learned that what I perceive to be important may not be what other users perceive to be important.
