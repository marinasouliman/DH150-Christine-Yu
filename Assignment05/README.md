### Sara Li's Scenario 

- Sara is an incoming freshman at UCLA. She is highly motivated to prove herself and determined to successfully gain a job in America after graduation. She is an international student from China and still struggles with unfamiliar English terms. She does not know anyone who is an international student and has a hard time comprehending what the requirements are for international students who want to stay in America. She has been searching the Economics website in hopes of finding an international students section on the website where she will be able to see the requirements in one place and contact upperclassmen for guidance. She wants to find campus resources for international students.

She clicks on one of the emails and begins to draft an email to her upperclassmen in hopes of booking a quick call to ask for advice. She sends the email to her upperclassmen and smiles because she is able to learn more about the international students' requirements to remain in America.

Frustration
- Sara does not have any international students as friends and since she is still in China, she is unable to ask any of her peers for help. There are some complicated English words she still does not fully understand and she feels lost. She browses through several forums in Chinese to see if they offer any help, but most of it does not apply to her situation. 

Solution

### Bobby Watson's Scenario

- Bobby is a rising junior at UCLA and has fully committed to the Economics major. He aspires to become a professor in the future and wants to go to graduate school. He wants to do research in economics prior to graduation. Bobby has been looking through Handshake and asking all his friends for information about research opportunities. He does not have much luck and it is difficult trying to filter through the many results on Handshake. Bobby has emailed professors with cover letters and his resume, but he continues to receive rejections. After all these rejections, Bobby is wondering if he should continue on his path to graduate school. Bobby tries to stay focused and he looks through the UCLA Economics website to see if there are open research positions. 

- Bobby opens his laptop and pulls up his spreadsheet for open research positions. He crosses out several that used to be open on his list. He ponders if there is an easier way to find these research opportunities. He types the UCLA Economics website into the search bar and opens the website. He quickly browses through the new research news and discovers that there is a link to an open portal for research in the sidebar. Bobby clicks the open portal link and it opens as a new tab. He sees that the open portal lists all research opportunities at UCLA and the search bar has multiple filters. He can filter by major so he can see all the internships that are relevant for Economics. The search can also filter by class and technical skills such as programming. Bobby clicks check marks by all the filters that are relevant to his class standing and skill level. He proceeds to search and finds the most up to date results for open research positions. Each of the positions have a brief summary with the professor's contacts listed next to it. It has the option to save the position to a list and send it to his email. He decides to discard his spreadsheet and begins making a new list on the open portal.
