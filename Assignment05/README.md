She is an international student from China and still struggles with unfamiliar English terms. She does not know anyone who is an international student and has a hard time comprehending what the requirements are for international students who want to stay in America. She has been searching the Economics website in hopes of finding an international students section on the website where she will be able to see the requirements in one place and contact upperclassmen for guidance. She wants to find campus resources for international students.

She looks up at the menu bar and discovers that there is menu section for International Resources. She opens up the page and she finds that there is a general overview for requirements that international students to know. She quickly reads through the requirements.

She sends the email to her upperclassmen and smiles because she is able to learn more about the international students' requirements to remain in America.
