## Scenarios and Journey Maps
### Sara Li's Scenario 

- Sara is an incoming freshman at UCLA. She is highly motivated to prove herself and determined to successfully gain a job in America after graduation. She is an international student from China and still struggles with unfamiliar English terms. She does not know anyone who is an international student and has a hard time comprehending what the requirements are for international students who want to stay in America. She has been searching the Economics website in hopes of finding an international students section on the website where she will be able to see the requirements in one place and contact upperclassmen for guidance. She wants to find campus resources for international students. 

- Sara is sitting in her house by her desktop computer. She opens Google Chrome and begins searching through the UCLA Economics website. She looks up at the menu bar and discovers that there is menu section for International Resources. She opens up the page and she finds that there is a general overview for requirements that international students to know. She quickly reads through the requirements. There is also a link to the Dashew Center for further resources. She opens that link in another tab for research later. On the bottom of the page, there are a few emails listed from upperclassmen that are open to contact for help. She clicks on one of the emails and begins to draft an email to her upperclassmen in hopes of booking a quick call to ask for advice. She sends the email to her upperclassmen and smiles because she is able to learn more about the international students' requirements to remain in America. Sara scrolls through the website and finds a pop-up for translating some of the hard to understand words to Chinese. She clicks accept and is able to better comprehend what is going on. 

### Sara's User Journey

Initiation 
- Sara lacks information about international students at UCLA. She wants to learn more about what restrictions international students face when obtaining internships and jobs in America. She is determined to make a plan for what she needs to accomplish in the next four years at UCLA. She wants to ask upperclassmen for helpful advice. 

Frustration
- Sara does not have any international students as friends and since she is still in China, she is unable to ask any of her peers for help. There are some complicated English words she still does not fully understand and she feels lost. She browses through several forums in Chinese to see if they offer any help, but most of it does not apply to her situation. 

Solution
- Sara discovers that the UCLA Economics website has a section for International Resources. Since it is on the menu bar, it is easy for her to click into that page and scroll through the resources. There are sections dedicated to the requirements, Dashew Center, and upperclassmen contact information.  

Achieving Goal
- Sara is able to send an email to her upperclassman and she is relieved to be able to see all the support that the Economics website offers. She opens the Dashew Center website in a new tab and she is able to see all the paperwork she should complete ahead of time for her visa. She sees that there is a pop-up option for translating the page into Chinese. She clicks accept and now she feels confident about navigating the uncertain process that international students face when transitioning to UCLA. 


### Bobby Watson's Scenario

He wants to do research in economics prior to graduation. Bobby has been looking through Handshake and asking all his friends for information about research opportunities. He does not have much luck and it is difficult trying to filter through the many results on Handshake. Bobby has emailed professors with cover letters and his resume, but he continues to receive rejections. After all these rejections, Bobby is wondering if he should continue on his path to graduate school. Bobby tries to stay focused and he looks through the UCLA Economics website to see if there are open research positions.
