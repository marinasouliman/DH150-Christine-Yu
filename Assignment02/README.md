## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

The UCLA Economics website is the primary source of information for classes, major requirements, resources, and research opportunities for economics majors studying at UCLA. It supplies information for the undergraduate, master, and Ph.D level. The user is able to search for available workshops, look into major requirements, and contact the counseling department through this website. 

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this website, several usability problems were apparent. 

- First, the website did a poor job with displaying the visibility of the system through the navigation side menu. It was unclear what page the user was located. 
- Second, the website struggled with error prevention by not providing suggestions for the search results. The search results also often appeared to be unrelated to the search term itself. To the user, the search function would appear unreliable. 
- Third, the UCLA Economics site fails to utilize a minimalistic design. 
- Fourth, the website's home page does not match the system and the real world, causing the user to question what the purpose the site serves. The home page focuses on research and publications from faculty. 
- Fifth, the search function lacks flexibility and efficiency of use. The search function does not have the ability to filter searches to a specific page. 

Given these problems, I will conduct a usability test to evaluate how the website enhances or hinders the user's ability to conduct certain tasks. A usability test is utilized to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product. In Task 1, I will ask the user to perform a search for Economics Requirements to determine the effectiveness of the function- whether the user can successfully complete the task or not.
