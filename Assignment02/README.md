## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

The UCLA Economics website is the primary source of information for classes, major requirements, resources, and research opportunities for economics majors studying at UCLA. It supplies information for the undergraduate, master, and Ph.D level. The user is able to search for available workshops, look into major requirements, and contact the counseling department through this website. 

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this website, several usability problems were apparent. 

- First, the website did a poor job with displaying the visibility of the system through the navigation side menu. It was unclear which page the user was located through the side menu. 
- Second, the website struggled with error prevention by not providing suggestions for the search results. The search results also often appeared to be unrelated to the search term itself and did not provide helpful information. To the user, the search function would appear unreliable. 
- Third, the UCLA Economics site fails to utilize a minimalistic design. 
- Fourth, the website's home page does not match the system and the real world, causing the user to question what the purpose the site serves. The home page focuses on research and publications from faculty. 
- Fifth, the search function lacks flexibility and efficiency of use. The search function does not have the ability to filter searches to a specific page. 

Given these problems, I will conduct a usability test to evaluate how the website enhances or hinders the user's ability to conduct certain tasks. A usability test is utilized to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product. In Task 1, I will ask the user to perform a search for Economics Requirements to determine how effective the search function is for retrieving results. This task will also demonstrate the extent to which the lack of error prevention creates a difficult experience for the user. It will further enlighten me as to what aspects of the search function can be improved. In Task 2, the user will locate career resources and pathways for an economics major. This will assess the efficiency of locating these pages. I can observe how the cluttered website affects the time it takes for a user to complete this task. In Task 3, the user is asked to find the counseling department in order to book an appointment with a counselor. Through the survey, I will be able to determine the degree to which the user is satisfied with the task and how comfortable the user is with utilizing the website. The goal is to understand and improve the website's usability from the user's perspective.

## Methodology

For the usability test,  I will conduct it within a quiet office room of my house. I will be using my own Macbook Air laptop as the recording device. I will be utilizing ActivePresenter. 

The user and I will sit adjacent to each other throughout this process. I will ask for the user's informed consent before progressing through the survey. The user will provide detailed feedback about their thought process and evaluate the extent to which task completion was successful. The user will also assess other elements such as how quickly tasks are completed, the degree of satisfaction and comfort the user feels toward the website, and potential suggestions for improvement. The user will complete a section on demographic data which will be kept confidential. 

This usability test is intended as a pilot test.

## Reflection

When conducting the usability test, I would frequently have to fight the urge to assist the user through the task as a more experienced user of the website. I was surprised by the degree of difficulty the novice user encountered when going through the first task. Although I expected there to be a challenge with the search results, I did not expect that minimizing the screen would cause the search bar to disappear on the website. This unexpected outcome caused me to intervene on the test and guide the user in the expected manner in full screen. For future user testing, I would ensure that I would avoid issues like that by testing out the screen beforehand. I also realized when reading the script out loud I had made several typos from copying and I would make sure to go through every detail to avoid these small mistakes in future user testing. 

I learned that the user felt that his prior expertise in technical information helped him conduct tasks more quickly relative to an average user. For an average user, this would presumably mean that the website is inefficient since results from tasks take a longer time than expected. The user recommended moving the "Contact Us" page to the top of the menu and incorporating admissions information into a single page. In my heuristics analysis, I found that the website was cluttered and the user agrees with that sentiment. 

The user expressed frustration at the first task and was unable to complete all the steps. He felt that the website had links that were often hidden from the user. He also stated he found the website cumbersome and rather complex. The user lacked confidence with the website, which implies he was not fairly comfortable with its use. He listed "intimidating" as one of the five words he associated with the UCLA Economics website. His user testing feedback indicates that this website needs a large degree of improvement. 

Overall, I learned about how a new user would view this website and was enlightened about how much of the website's poor design I gradually overlooked as I used it more frequently. I would say the user testing went well because I gained insight into what a user would change about the UCLA Economics website. I realized that I often had questions about his experience that were not part of the script and I would incorporate them into user testing as long as it does not distract from the main task. The user also did not frequently speak during the tasks and I would have to prompt the user to remember to think aloud. As a moderator, I would need to have flexibility to deal with unexpected situations such as the mishap with the website search bar disappearing. I need to be more careful with script preparation and utilize more checks for user testing in the future. I learned that my opinions may slightly differ from the user's opinions;however, it is the user's perspective that is important for determining what the website should improve.
