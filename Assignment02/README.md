## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

The UCLA Economics website is the primary source of information for classes, major requirements, resources, and research opportunities for economics majors studying at UCLA. It supplies information for the undergraduate, master, and Ph.D level. The user is able to search for available workshops, look into major requirements, and contact the counseling department through this website. 

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this website, several usability problems were apparent. 

- First, the website did a poor job with displaying the visibility of the system through the navigation side menu. It was unclear which page the user was located through the side menu. 
- Second, the website struggled with error prevention by not providing suggestions for the search results. The search results also often appeared to be unrelated to the search term itself and did not provide helpful information. To the user, the search function would appear unreliable. 
- Third, the UCLA Economics site fails to utilize a minimalistic design. 
- Fourth, the website's home page does not match the system and the real world, causing the user to question what the purpose the site serves. The home page focuses on research and publications from faculty. 
- Fifth, the search function lacks flexibility and efficiency of use. The search function does not have the ability to filter searches to a specific page. 

Given these problems, I will conduct a usability test to evaluate how the website enhances or hinders the user's ability to conduct certain tasks. A usability test is utilized to examine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product. In Task 1, I will ask the user to perform a search for Economics Requirements to determine how effective the search function is for retrieving results. This task will also demonstrate the extent to which the lack of error prevention creates a difficult experience for the user. It will further enlighten me as to what aspects of the search function can be improved. In Task 2, the user will locate career resources and pathways for an economics major. This will assess the efficiency of locating these pages. I can observe how the cluttered website affects the time it takes for a user to complete this task. In Task 3, the user is asked to find the counseling department in order to book an appointment with a counselor. Through the survey, I will be able to determine the degree to which the user is satisfied with the task and how comfortable the user is with utilizing the website. The goal is to understand and improve the website's usability from the user's perspective.

## Methodology

For the usability test,  I will conduct it within a quiet office room of my house. I will be using my own Macbook Air laptop as the recording device. I will be utilizing ActivePresenter. 

The user and I will sit adjacent to each other throughout this process. I will ask for the user's informed consent before progressing through the survey. The user will provide detailed feedback about their thought process and evaluate the extent to which task completion was successful. The user will also assess other elements such as how quickly tasks are completed, the degree of satisfaction and comfort the user feels toward the website, and potential suggestions for improvement.
