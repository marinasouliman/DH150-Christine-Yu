## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

The UCLA Economics website is the primary source of information for classes, major requirements, resources, and research opportunities for economics majors studying at UCLA. It supplies information for the undergraduate, master, and Ph.D level. The user is able to search for available workshops, look into major requirements, and contact the counseling department through this website. 

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this website, several usability problems were apparent. 

- First, the website did a poor job with displaying the visibility of the system through the navigation side menu. 
- Second, the website struggled with error prevention by not providing suggestions for the search results. The search results also often appeared to be unrelated to the search term itself. To the user, the search function would appear unreliable. 
- Third, the UCLA Economics site fails to utilize a minimalistic design. 
- Fourth, the website does not match the system and the real world, causing the user to question what the purpose the site serves.
