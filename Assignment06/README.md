# Assignment 06: Low-Fidelity Prototype
## Christine Yu DH 150 Spring 2020

### Project Description

My project is based on the UCLA Economics website. The Economics website serves as the main source of information for economics majors regarding research news, class requirements, and career pathways. 

For this project, I chose to focus on the functionality of essential features such as search, workshop registration, and international resources. My user research revealed that the search functionality of the website was lacking in many ways, ranging from unhelpful results to lack of error prevention.

**User Personas** The first persona is Justin who is an incoming freshman at UCLA. Justin wants to search for the pre major requirements for Business Economics and compare it to the pre major requirements for Economics. He wants to utilize this information for his decisions to take certain classes during freshman year. The second persona is Betty who is a recently graduated alumni of UCLA. She wants to stay up to date on the newest ideas for her finance position. She is interested in participating in several workshops and wants to link it to her calendar. The third persona is Peter who is an international student from China. He is uncertain about the types of resources available to international students and wants to learn more on the Economics website. 

Through examining the motivations of these user personas, I was able to decide on three features to prototype for these users. 
1. **Improved Search Results** - provides a clear concise list of search results 
2. **Workshop Linked to Calendar** - allows linkage of workshops with any calendar
3. **International Resources Section** - offers information about international students resources

## Tasks
The low-fidelity prototype supports these tasks:

1. Input search keywords. 
2. Provide search suggestions.
3. Generate a list of search results.
4. View resources for international students. 
5. View workshops available.  
6. Link workshop sign up to the calendar.

## Notes from User

1. The user stated that the calendar should utilize brief labels of what event is happening on each day. He stated that it should be similar to the labels that show on Google Calendar where the labels are small and it can be clicked to enlarge the information within. It was unclear since the calendar was blank which event would occur on what day. 

2. The user asked if the International Resources page provides more information such as cell phone number and email of Dashew Center if you scroll down. That means that some of the essential information he expected to be on the page was missing and was not sure if it could be easily found. 

3. The user decided to place check marks next to wireframes that made sense and were relatively intuitive to understand and placed x marks next to wireframes that require some degree of revision. 

4. User would like to be able to select a range of dates on the calendar. The user also found it rather annoying and frustrating that users would have to click on each individual date to look at the workshops open on each day. 

5. User did like that the search bar was included on every page since it would be much easier to search without having to redirect to the home page everytime he wanted to perform a search. 

6. User stated that he would want to make sure that the home page has a label to indicate that workshops are available with an arrow to the calendar. This would improve clarity for users that workshops are found under the calendar. 

7. The user found that he would like to have a list of the main events or highlights of the month on the home page. 

8. He stated that he liked the options for editing and being able to return to the page to edit or review any details on the workshop sign up page.
