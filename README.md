# UX Design to Improve Usability 
## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristics Analysis by Christine Yu

Motivation 

I chose to focus on analyzing websites that are frequently used by economics majors of University of California, Los Angeles, in particular the UCLA official website for economics and the UCLA Summer sessions website. As a frequent user of both these websites, I noticed flaws that can deter users from having an easy to navigate experience. An unpleasant experience can provide difficulties for future economics students and introduce frustrations. Therefore, I aim to label and analyze these flaws using the Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems. I hope by doing so I am able to propose potential ways to improve the user experience and interaction with these two websites. 

## First Website- UCLA Economics Website
https://economics.ucla.edu/

Information about the Website:
  
  The UCLA Economics website serves as the primary source of knowledge about classes, research, and workshops for economics majors at all levels starting from the undergraduate to the Ph.D. The website explains that the Economics Department at UCLA has two particular objectives- conduct cutting edge research and train the next generation of economic leaders. In this website, it lists its central navigation under 7 menus- "About", "Faculty", "Undergraduate", "Master", "Ph.D", "Alumni", and "Calendar". Users utilize this website to receive updated information from the economics department regarding new opportunities or classes, read research publications, and connect with various resources to further develop career opportunities. The website is managed by the UCLA Department of Economics.
