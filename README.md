# UX Design to Improve Usability 
## DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristics Analysis by Christine Yu

Motivation 

I chose to focus on analyzing websites that are frequently used by economics majors of University of California, Los Angeles, in particular the UCLA official website for economics and the UCLA Summer sessions website. As a frequent user of both these websites, I noticed flaws that can deter users from having an easy to navigate experience. An unpleasant experience can provide difficulties for future economics students and introduce frustrations. Therefore, I aim to label and analyze these flaws using the Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems. I hope by doing so I am able to propose potential ways to improve the user experience and interaction with these two websites. 

## First Website- UCLA Economics Website
https://economics.ucla.edu/

Information about the Website:
  
  The UCLA Economics website serves as the primary source of knowledge about classes, research, and workshops for economics majors at all levels starting from the undergraduate to the Ph.D. The website explains that the Economics Department at UCLA has two particular objectives- conduct cutting edge research and train the next generation of economic leaders. In this website, it lists its central navigation under 7 menus- "About", "Faculty", "Undergraduate", "Master", "Ph.D", "Alumni", and "Calendar". Users utilize this website to receive updated information from the economics department regarding new opportunities or classes, read research publications, and connect with various resources to further develop career opportunities. The website is managed by the UCLA Department of Economics.

Initial Evaluation:

My first impression of the website is it can be quite cluttered graphically because there are large sections of information to process on the homepage. Navigation to the required information can be difficult if you are using the navigation menu offered because there are a large number of hypertext links to pages. There is a search bar; however, the search bar is particularly small, which can cause readers with sight issues to have trouble finding the information. The lettering for the menu navigation in the sidebar are all listed in capital letters and blue text, making it difficult to read and pinpoint clear distinctions between website pages. It creates a mildly unpleasant experience for the users. It appears that the website was designed without consideration of user experience and simplicity. 

## 1) Visibility of System Status

The website does not always make it clear which page of the website we are on. For example, when you click into a webpage, the menu sidebar does not change so it is unclear which page of navigation we are currently on. Typically, it would be expected that the web page navigation link would be bolded, capitalized, or a different color to ensure the user knows which section they are at. The title of the webpage is listed in large typography, which can offset this issue; however, the user will still struggle to know the system status from the sidebar alone. By lacking this progress indicator, the user may click the links on the menu sidebar multiple times because it is unclear if the first navigation attempt worked. I would propose changing the menu sidebar link so that it is a different color such as black to make the navigation clear. Severity Rating (2)

When the user is navigated to the giving page, it is unclear what the blue button on the screen is meant to do. A user may not know to click on the blue button to navigate to the donation page. When a user does click on the button, it changes to black and yellow and indicates the word "donate" only for a few seconds. I propose labeling clearly that the button is meant to redirect a user to the donation page by labeling "donate" on the button prior to clicking. Severity Rating (2)

## 2) Match between System and the Real World

On the home page, it does not provide a clear introduction to the website so it makes first time users uncertain as to where to navigate to find information that they require. The home page appears to primarily be made of news from faculty, research spotlights, and events. Usually when users face a website for the first time, they will read an introduction on the home page so that it is clear what the organization provides and where they should go to find more information. The UCLA Economics home page fails to address those questions and leaves novice users lost when they try to navigate the website. The user may even assume that they were directed to the faculty page rather than the overall economics department website. The page does not follow real world conventions. Severity Rating (3)
