# UCLA Economics Website Prototyping Project
## Christine Yu DH 150 UX/UI

### Introduction 
In this project, I propose a new UX design for navigating the UCLA Economics website. The UCLA Economics website provides several services to the UCLA student population: it offers resources for transitioning into career pathways, searching for class requirements, reading new research, and signing up for workshops. While many resources are offered on the UCLA Economics website, there are a few improvements that could be implemented. Search results were often poorly formated and unhelpful. Sections of the website failed to provide sufficient insight for international students. Workshop sign ups could be enhanced by drawing more attention to the various seminars and increasing attendance by linking to calendars. By recognizing the search issues and lack of international student resources, I was motivated to provide a more accessible and satisfactory user experience. As a frequent user of the website, I believe these proposed changes will be able to serve a wider section of the student population and provide clear answers for any questions that students and parents may have. 

### Design Statement
In this increasingly globalized society, it is important to have a reliable source of information and provide insights that apply to a larger community of people. When lacking clear search results, community members would find it difficult to understand and follow the actual process of selecting classes. Users will experience frustrations with navigating an unclear process especially those from an international background. The UCLA Economics department will be perceived as unreliable. By resolving the issue of disorganization and improving communication, it prioritizes the community members' needs for dependable resources and accessibility. 

### Competitor analysis
#### Heuristic Evaluation
I conducted a heuristic analysis of two websites that targeted the UCLA population: UCLA Economics and Summer Sessions. I utilized Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems and analyze the severity of issues that existed on the two websites. I found that the UCLA Economics website has several problems ranging from cluttered graphics to inability to provide error prevention in search results. There were also issues with its flexibility and efficiency of use.

#### Usability Testing
I conducted a usability test to understand how other users perceive the website and evaluate how the website enhances or hinders the user's ability to conduct certain tasks. The user will go through three tasks: perform a search for Economics Requirements, locate career resources and pathways for an economics major, and find the counseling department in order to book an appointment with a counselor. 

I learned that the user would encounter frustrations due to inability to complete the first task and found that the website was complicated and difficult to navigate. He felt the website had links that were often hidden from the user. The user noted that the website is "intimidating" and those with less technical knowledge would struggle with the website.

### User research: Contextual Inquiry
Through contextual inquiry, I observed how a user would naturally navigate the academic search process without any guidance. By examining my target demographic, I am able to gain insights into the context of use, general preferences, concerns, and troubles that a typical user would encounter. I learned that search for the users is primarily performed through computer and that means the website experience should be optimized for the computer. Academic information that is commonly searched for are course descriptions, materials and textbooks required, and professor's ratings. The user expects an intuitive search process and would like to experience a larger range of results through partial word searches. This information is helpful because it reduces the impact of my own preconceived notions of what may be beneficial to the users.

### UX storytelling
In UX storytelling, I created 3 personas that revealed distinct motivations and needs for the UCLA Economics website. It helps open my eyes to what sort of issues I should address within the website. The user's journey explains a user's progression from a challenge to its resolution. This aspect of UX storytelling can help develop ideas for solving usability issues.

1. Sara Li is an incoming freshman at UCLA. She is an international student from China and still struggles with unfamiliar English terms. She has been searching the Economics website in hopes of finding an international students section on the website where she will be able to see the requirements in one place and contact upperclassmen for guidance. She wants to find campus resources for international students.

2. Bobby Watson is a rising junior at UCLA. He wants to do research in economics prior to graduation. Bobby has emailed professors with cover letters and his resume, but he continues to receive rejections. After all these rejections, Bobby is wondering if he should continue on his path to graduate school. Bobby looks through the UCLA Economics website to see if there are open research positions.

3. Jeff Baylor is a high school student. He would like to become an Economics major if he is admitted to UCLA. Jeff knows that most colleges accept AP credits, but he wants to know the specific types of credit his AP courses could count for in terms of Economics prerequisites. He hopes that he could shorten the time he needs to spend doing pre-major courses so he can take out fewer loans in college. Jeff browses the UCLA Economics website to see if they have AP credits listed on the website.

I learned that these personas would benefit from an International Resources menu section, open research portal, and improved search capabilities in the UCLA Economics website. [read more…](https://github.com/ruruchouu/DH150-Christine-Yu/blob/master/Assignment05/README.md)

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation
The wireframe allows me to conceptualize what design elements are needed to provide these solutions. The sketches show how a user would search for international resources, generate search results, choose a calendar workshop, sign up for a workshop, and link the workshop to their personal calendar.
