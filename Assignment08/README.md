# UCLA Economics Website Prototyping Project
## Christine Yu DH 150 UX/UI

### Introduction 
In this project, I propose a new UX design for navigating the UCLA Economics website. The UCLA Economics website provides several services to the UCLA student population: it offers resources for transitioning into career pathways, searching for class requirements, reading new research, and signing up for workshops. While many resources are offered on the UCLA Economics website, there are a few improvements that could be implemented. Search results were often poorly formated and unhelpful. Sections of the website failed to provide sufficient insight for international students. Workshop sign ups could be enhanced by drawing more attention to the various seminars and increasing attendance by linking to calendars. By recognizing the search issues and lack of international student resources, I was motivated to provide a more accessible and satisfactory user experience. As a frequent user of the website, I believe these proposed changes will be able to serve a wider section of the student population and provide clear answers for any questions that students and parents may have. 

### Design Statement
In this increasingly globalized society, it is important to have a reliable source of information and provide insights that apply to a larger community of people. When lacking clear search results, community members would find it difficult to understand and follow the actual process of selecting classes. Users will experience frustrations with navigating an unclear process especially those from an international background. The UCLA Economics department will be perceived as unreliable. By resolving the issue of disorganization and improving communication, it prioritizes the community members' needs for dependable resources and accessibility.
